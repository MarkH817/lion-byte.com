## Experience

### Development Manager - Senior Design Project

#### August 2017 - Present

The UNL Senior Design led by Professor Myra Cohen is called "Sound of Code." It is an interactive JavaScript web application for learning and hearing JavaScript. This application augments user JavaScript with sounds to play at runtime. This allows users to visualize and hear their programs as well as their errors.

As a development manager, I performed regular code reviews, maintained the build pipeline, and assisted teammates with new features.

### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant

#### January 2017 - Present

CSCE 156 - Computer Science II (Java)

I assisted students in their coursework for assignments and weekly lab sessions and held regular office hours in the Student Resource Center.

I gave feedback to Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) based on students' comments regarding labs and assignments.
