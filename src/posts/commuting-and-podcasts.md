title: Commuting and Podcasts
---

Ha, well it's been a while since I last wrote a post here. Working on summer
projects, finishing my last classes, and moving to Omaha filled up my past 6
months. During that time, I’ve been commuting to Lincoln, which was lengthy
compared to having everything within 15 minutes.

For the first couple of months, I just had the radio playing. However, the
signal to my favorite station gets hazy the closer I get to Lincoln. Other
stations played either five songs on repeat or country songs. I grabbed my
Spotify Discover Weekly for at least two months, but sometimes the algorithm
missed my tastes pretty badly.

I mixed in podcasts between weekly playlists. It turns out that this was the
perfect situation to listen and catch up on lengthy podcast episodes. They’ve
made my 2 hours of driving per day something to enjoy rather than suffer!

My main collection of podcasts includes:

- **Syntax** - This is all about web development, but they’re a lot more lively
  than most others on the topic.
- **Developer Tea** - This podcast focuses on the human-side of software
  development: stress, goal management, the reasons behind fundamental rules in
  development, etc.
- **Wonderful!** - An enthusiast podcast celebrating the small or large items or
  activities!
- **Shmanners** - An etiquette podcast for often unspoken rules in special
  occasions.
- **My Brother, My Brother, and Me** - A comedy podcast by three brothers giving
  advice comedically.

I’ve been listening to most of these for over a year; I came across Developer
Tea only three months ago. I would wholeheartedly recommend checking out these
shows if you’re curious.
