title: Year in Review - 2019
---

Last year was wild all around.

Since I graduated from UNL December 2018, I was relieved of one source of
constant anxiety. Although, I didn't have a job lined up beforehand, so I was
pretty much scrambling to find interviews here in Omaha.

After about 2 months of searching and sending resumes, I was hired at National
Indemnity Company. It was exciting to start my first full-time job, but I knew
that I wasn't working with the latest technologies. Regardless, I did gain
skills and techniques for working with legacy codebases.

Months passed, and I still felt like my already developed skills weren't being
put to good use. I knew git and git workflows. I knew about writing
pure/semi-pure functions and unit testing them. I knew so much modern JavaScript
features and knew that they would never be used here. Obviously I was
nit-picking what I didn't like, but I was really concerned about falling behind
the rest of the industry.

Additional factors at work eventually led to my decision to find work elsewhere.
Luckily, Derek Waskel, an old classmate of mine, reached out to me for a
position at gWorks. It felt strange to leave a place only after 8 months, but I
felt this was the best choice to make. I've been really satisfied being a part
of the team here.

Last year, I wrote goals did not really meet them. To be fair, they were
extremely vague and I had less free-time to focus on them. I've actually stopped
having new year resolutions and opted towards a lookback approach; hence, this
post. No one can tell the future, and I don't feel like disappointing myself
with arbitrary goals.
