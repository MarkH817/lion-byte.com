Ha, well it's been a while since I last wrote a post here. The past 6 months have been pretty busy with my summer research projects and final classes for graduation!

I also moved to Omaha while still taking my classes in Lincoln, so I had a lot of time to myself on the road. Having 2 hours of my day used up just for traveling was kind of a challenge at first. Everything used to be walking distance living on campus. My scheduling skills improved since time became a lot more restricted.

Rather than involuntarily memorize the same five songs on the radio, I had some fun, lighthearted podcasts to keep me company.
